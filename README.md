AI-Jombu

Jumbo was a program written by Douglas Hofstadter between 1980 and 1982 to explore the parallel terraced scan approach to modeling human cognition.
Jombu is a program written by me in 2024 to recapitulate that development. If you wanted Jumbo, well, we've got Jumbo at home, and it's Jombu.
